# The next line declares that we'll be using additional resources in our theme such as CSS or JS
libraries:
  # The following line tells Drupal where to find the references to these resources. Syntax matters here (indent and use a hyphen then a space and single quotes). This is a path 'x2' refers to our theme directory and 'global-everything refers to the section name defined inside the '*.libraries.yml' file in the root of othe theme directory. Using this method you can make lists of libraries in the *libraries.yml file but only call for the ones you want to use from here.
  - 'infoaction/global-everything'
# Next line declares a 'region' section. If none are defined here, Drupal will automatically assign a default set of regions because the system can't function without them. Region defined as 'content: Whatever Name You Want' MUST exist as part of your custom list. Left-hand key is used by the machine: no space, no caps; right-hand Value is for humans like you and me, space OK but ensure consistency by wrsapping in single quotes (its seems there is no considtency to the single quote stuff. Testing and reference to the Bartik theme reveals that regions are still labelled correctly and function correctly in the system.)
regions:
    # Region names cannot have hyphens; probably something to do with PHP?
